# Helper functions

The temporary place for helper functions during development. I think at the end, all helper functions should stay in our component library with a short description even if they are used only in one app. Staying in the component library increases the probability for reusing because every developer can easily take a look to the helpers section of our component library to see if there is still something that fits to his needs.
