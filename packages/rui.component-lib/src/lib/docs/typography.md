## Why typography components?

Ant Design offers us some predefined typography components. But only a few and these are by far not enough for our long term requirements.

**Bulding our own typography components has several advantages:**

1. We need to define text stylings only one time in one place like in good css stylesheets.
2. If we want to change the design of a specific text we have to change it only in one place like in good css stylesheets.
3. We can give different text types meaningful names e.g. ErrorMsg like in good css stylesheets.
4. We can select specific html tags depending on the usecase e.g strong oder emphazize like in good semantic html documents.

_In other words. Typography components are the answer to solve several common styling problems with React and Styled Components. They are comparable to normal css classes extended with the ability of changeable values and changeable html tags. They increasing the consistency of our styles and faciliate cleaner and more readable css code._
